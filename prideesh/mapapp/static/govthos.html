public hospital, or government hospital, is a hospital which is government owned and is fully funded by the government
 and operates solely off the money that is collected from taxpayers to fund healthcare initiatives. In some countries, this
 type of hospital provides medical care free of charge to patients, covering expenses and wages by government reimbursement.
 There are several advantages of a government hospital for a patient, including: Cost: Government hospitals typically offer 
 services at a lower cost, or even for free, making healthcare more accessible for low-income and uninsured individuals.
