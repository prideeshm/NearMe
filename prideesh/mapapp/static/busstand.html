A bus stand, also called a bus bay, or bus stance, is a designated parking location where a bus or
 coach waits out of service between scheduled public transport services. 'Bus stand' is also often an
  alternative name for specific bus stops inside a bus station. A bus station is a structure where buses
   stop to pick up and drop off passengers. A bus station is larger than a bus stop, which is usually a
    place on the roadside where buses stop. Some bus stations are terminal stations, which means that station
     is the end of the route.
